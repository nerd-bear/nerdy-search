# Nerdy Search

A visual search-engine wrapper for cozy OperaGX vibes. This is a simple 220~ line project built with HTML, CSS, JS, and tailwind. The search query process is nearly nonexistent, all that happens is that your query gets redirected to Google. Your recent searches are saved in your cookies and can be viewed directly on the page. If you allow audio playing for the website, a cozy ambient rain sound. The page does not ask the user for permission to play audio, to not annoy the user. So it needs to be enabled manually.
